It contains the same PAN details as a physical PAN card but is available in a digital format. It can be downloaded online and used as a valid identification document for various purposes. The e-PAN card is usually issued in a PDF format.\\n2. Physical PAN card: A physical PAN card is a laminated card with your PAN details printed on it. It is a physical document that can be carried and used as a valid identification proof. The physical PAN card is sent to the applicant's registered address by post.\\n\\nBoth e-PAN and physical PAN cards have the same validity and can be used for identification purposes.

Firstly, if they wish to carry out any financial transactions in India such as opening a bank account, investing in stocks, purchasing or selling property, or investing in India, a PAN card is required.
