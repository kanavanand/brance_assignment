It contains the same PAN details as a physical PAN card but is available in a digital format. It can be downloaded online and used as a valid identification document for various purposes. The e-PAN card is usually issued in a PDF format.\\n2. Physical PAN card: A physical PAN card is a laminated card with your PAN details printed on it. It is a physical document that can be carried and used as a valid identification proof. The physical PAN card is sent to the applicant's registered address by post.\\n\\nBoth e-PAN and physical PAN cards have the same validity and can be used for identification purposes.

A basic overview to understand the importance of PAN Card with respect to these three accounts can be understood as:\\n\\n**NRE:**\\xa0For funds earned outside India where both Principal and Interest earned are tax-free.
